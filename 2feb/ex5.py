# Exercise 5: Palindromes (from Project Euler 4)
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the
# product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã– 99.
# ! Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# TODO list of all products of two 3-digit numbers, then iterate and look for palindromes, give largest one
